REMEMBER TO CREATE A .env FILE IN THE BACKEND FOLDER!!!!!!

I added it to .gitignore for this repository for security reasons so if you clone this repository, you'll need to recreate it.

It needs FLASK_SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL.

Also a MySQL database is needed for the backend for user log ins and note storage.
The schema database model for these 2 tables can be found in base.by in the backend folder.
